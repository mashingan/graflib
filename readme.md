# Graflib
This is minimal implementation of graph library. Using generic for labelling
and for adding a weight type.  
Hopefully this can be expanded to more generic graph implementation.

The current implementation is able to

1. Make graph, directed and undirected together with its weight.
2. Find nodes' neighbours within defined mapping.
3. Find the paths between origin node to destination node using DFS.

Expansion will be planned when I have read/learn more about graph theory
